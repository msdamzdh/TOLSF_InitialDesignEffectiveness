# Cantilever Beam Topology Optimization

This MATLAB code performs topology optimization for a cantilever beam using the level set method. It aims to minimize compliance while maintaining a target volume fraction.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `Canteliver_Moment.m` file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cantilever-optimization.git
```

## Usage

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing `Canteliver_Moment.m`.
2. Run the script:

```matlab
run Canteliver_Moment.m
```

## Configuration

Adjust the main parameters at the beginning of the script:

```matlab
MP = struct("Emax",1,"Emin",1e-3,"v",0.3);
GP = struct("ngp",4,"nor",1,"dx",1,"dy",1,"X0",0,"Y0",30,"lx",60,"ly",30);
OPP = struct("tho",0.5,"Noi",1000,"dt",0.05,"SP",1);
```

- `MP`: Material properties
- `GP`: Geometry parameters
- `OPP`: Optimization parameters

## Boundary Conditions

Modify the Essential Boundary Conditions (EBC) and Natural Boundary Conditions (NBC) in the script:

```matlab
indEBC = find(NodeCoord(:,1)==0);
EBC = [indEBC,zeros(numel(indEBC),2)];
indNBC = find(abs(NodeCoord(:,2)-15)<=0.1 & NodeCoord(:,1)==60);
NBC = [indNBC,zeros(numel(indNBC),1),-1/numel(indNBC)*ones(numel(indNBC),1)];
```

## Running the Optimization

1. Set the desired number of iterations in `OPP.Noi`.
2. Run the script in MATLAB.
3. The optimization will proceed, displaying progress at each iteration.

## Visualization

Set `OPP.SP = 1` to display the evolving optimized shape after each iteration.

## Output

The script outputs:
- Optimized shape of the cantilever beam
- Convergence history of the objective function and volume fraction

## Customization

You can modify various aspects of the code:
- Mesh resolution: Change `dx` and `dy`
- Domain size: Adjust `lx` and `ly`
- Material properties: Modify the `MP` structure
- Optimization parameters: Update the `OPP` structure
